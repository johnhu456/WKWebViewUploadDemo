# WKWebViewUploadDemo
This is a demo from [https://github.com/mbarnig/WKWebView](https://github.com/mbarnig/WKWebView). But add upload file function.

In page '百度', clicked the upload image button, then upload an image file which name contains Chinese(or non-English characters)， you may found upload failed.  Not just in '百度', any page use "\<input type='file'>" to upload file would not work right too.  
This may a WKWebView bug?   
Waiting for solution...
